Treating the opposite gender equally is what we are implying in this site. As a student, our overview of gender 
equality is that the level of respect and the treatment is at the same level. There is no greater or powerful gender
if the treatment with each other is the same. Some places that doesn't care about gender equality but the superior 
sex is more dominating. Harassing of other gender specially LGBT people is the main focus in our site so that 
readers will be inspired if they visit this site.
